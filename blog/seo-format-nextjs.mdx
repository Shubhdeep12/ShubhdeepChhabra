Organizing your Next.js application and using components.

Imagine you want to use Next.js to build an application and that you want each page to have a distinct SEO strategy as well as the same header, footer, and navbar.

What you can manage to do?

The simple option is to build a shared component that is called repeatedly on each page.

But, You might try this 👇

- I hope you have already developed a Next.js app before reading this. If not, visit this page 👉 [https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started)
- Create two components with the names **Format** and SEOSetup in a new folder called **components** inside the src directory. This component, “Format,” refers to the layout of the page. Here, in this case, the layout of every page will be in this flow **Navbar** then **Main** content, and then a **Footer**. And, We are therefore defining it below 👇

```js
import { FC } from 'react'

import Footer from '../Footer'
import Navbar from '../Navbar'

const Format: FC = (props) => {
	return (
		<>
			<Navbar />
			<Main>{props.children}</Main>
			<Footer />
		</>
	)
}

export default Format
```

- In **SEOSetup**, we’re really constructing a common tag with data supplied as props for the meta and title tag fields. So that we may utilize this **SEOSetup** component each time we need to define SEO-related information on a page rather than creating a head tag repeatedly.

```js
import Head from 'next/head'

export interface MetaData {
	title: string;
	description: string;
}

const SEOSetup: FC<MetaData> = (props) => {
	const { title, description } = props

	return (
		<Head>
			<title>{title}</title>
			<meta name={'title'} content={title} />
			<meta name={'description'} content={description} />
		</Head>
	)
}

export default SEOSetup
```

- Finally, utilize them on a page. Here we are just wrapping the page with the Format component and setting up SEO with our custom **SEOSetup** tag.

```js
import type { NextPage } from 'next'

import Format from '../components/Format'
import SEOSetup from '../components/SEOSetup'

const Home: NextPage = () => {
	return (
		<Format>
			<SEOSetup title='This is title of the Home Page' description='This is description of Home Page' />
			<div>This is Home Page.</div>
		</Format>
	)
}

export default Home
```
